DevExtreme HTML5 JavaScript Tree List is&nbsp;a&nbsp;React component that displays hierarchical data in&nbsp;a&nbsp;table. Its main features include robust data layer, multiple editing modes, client-side data validation, numerous filtering and searching options, and many more. Tree List operates&nbsp;in [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) or&nbsp;[uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) state mode and can be&nbsp;used with Redux. Advanced UI&nbsp;customization is&nbsp;carried out using template components and [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html). Declared [PropTypes for typechecking](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) are also included.
