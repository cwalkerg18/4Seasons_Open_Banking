DevExtreme HTML5 JavaScript Scheduler is&nbsp;a&nbsp;React component for scheduling. It&nbsp;implements all the features necessary for its purpose: flexible data binding, easy appointment editing, multiple calendar views, time zones support, and more. The Scheduler can operate&nbsp;in [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) or&nbsp;[uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) state mode and can be&nbsp;used with Redux. Advanced UI&nbsp;customization is&nbsp;carried out using template components and [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html). Declared [PropTypes for typechecking](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) are also included.
