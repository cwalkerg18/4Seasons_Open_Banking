The **DataGrid** can adapt its layout to&nbsp;narrow screens. If&nbsp;screen width is&nbsp;not enough to&nbsp;display all columns, the widget hides them according to&nbsp;the specified priority. To&nbsp;view values of&nbsp;hidden columns, click the ellipsis button in&nbsp;the last column of&nbsp;the required row. Switch between the landscape and portrait layouts to&nbsp;see how the **DataGrid** looks on&nbsp;wide and narrow screens.
