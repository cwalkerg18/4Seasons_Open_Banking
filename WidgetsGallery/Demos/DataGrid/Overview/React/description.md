DevExtreme HTML5 JavaScript Data Grid is&nbsp;a&nbsp;feature-rich grid control that can be&nbsp;used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;React component. Its main features include robust data layer, fast data processing, client-side data validation, and many more. Advanced UI&nbsp;customization is&nbsp;carried out using template components and [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html). Data Grid can operate&nbsp;in [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) or&nbsp;[uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) state mode and can be&nbsp;used with Redux. Declared [PropTypes for typechecking](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) are included.
