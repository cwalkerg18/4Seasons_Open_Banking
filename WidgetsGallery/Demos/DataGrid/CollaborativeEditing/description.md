This demo shows how users can use a SignalR service that broadcasts push notifications to edit the **DataGrid**'s data in real time. You can open this page in another browser window and start editing to see this functionality. Changes made in one window are repeated in the other.
 
You can share the session ID (under the **DataGrid**) with other users to edit the **DataGrid** collectively.
 
Note that all changes are lost if you refresh the page because the SignalR service only broadcasts changes without saving them.
