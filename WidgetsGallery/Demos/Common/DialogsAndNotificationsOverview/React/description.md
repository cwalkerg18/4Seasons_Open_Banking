DevExtreme HTML5 JavaScript Dialog and Notification components for React include several popup widgets used to&nbsp;interact with an&nbsp;app. This demo shows two of&nbsp;them: Popup and Popover. All the components operate&nbsp;in [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) or&nbsp;[uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) state mode and can be&nbsp;used with Redux. Advanced UI&nbsp;customization is&nbsp;carried out using template components and [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html). Declared [PropTypes for typechecking](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) are included as&nbsp;well.
