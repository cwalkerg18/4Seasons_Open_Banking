DevExtreme provides a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;client-side navigation controls that can be&nbsp;used in&nbsp;Vue applications. They include TreeView, TabPanel, NavBar, and many others. You can use Vue syntax and techniques to&nbsp;instantiate and configure the controls or&nbsp;handle their events. In addition, the&nbsp;components support [prop validation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#Prop-Validation) and templates that use [named slots](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-slots.html#Named-Slots).
