DevExtreme HTML5 JavaScript Navigation Controls are adaptive React components that help you implement navigation in&nbsp;your application. All the controls operate&nbsp;in [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) or&nbsp;[uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) state mode and can be&nbsp;used with Redux. Declared [PropTypes for typechecking](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) are included. In&nbsp;addition, the controls support advanced&nbsp;UI customization using template components and [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html).
