DevExtreme HTML5 JavaScript Maps include two interactive React components for creating GPS navigation maps and vector maps. The Map component works with Google Maps and Bing Maps API, supports roadmap, satellite, and hybrid views, and allows a&nbsp;user to&nbsp;create markers and routes. The Vector Map component comes with predefined data sources, a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;colorization modes, and multiple legends. Both components operate&nbsp;in [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) or&nbsp;[uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) state mode and can be&nbsp;used with Redux. Advanced UI&nbsp;customization is&nbsp;carried out using template components and [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html). Declared [PropTypes for typechecking](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) are included as&nbsp;well.
